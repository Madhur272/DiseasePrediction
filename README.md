# DiseasePrediction
A disease prediction model analyses a wide variety of medical data, such as patient demographics, clinical history, diagnostic test results, genetic information, and lifestyle variables, using sophisticated computational algorithms. 
The model may determine risk factors, early warning signals, and prediction indicators linked to different diseases or health problems by looking for patterns and linkages within this data. 
The programme learns from past data using statistical analysis and machine learning to forecast an individual's likelihood of contracting particular diseases. 
In order to improve patient outcomes and improve healthcare delivery as a whole, healthcare providers can use these predictions to customise early interventions, preventative measures, and personalised treatment programmes.

Algorithms Explored
The following algorithms have been explored in code:

1. Naive Bayes
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Random Forest

Data used for training is stored in 'Training.csv' and for testing is stored in 'Testing.csv'. Both the files are uploaded in the attached zip folder.
